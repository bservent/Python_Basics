#DATA TYPES IN PYTHON

#Immutable = strings, numbers, tuples
#mutable = dictionaries, lists, sets

#Numbers = integers, floating point numbers, or complex numbers

num1=100
print(type(num1))

#example above is an integer

###type() is a built in function in Python that takes in either one or three parameters. In the example above it is taking in the variable and checking what its associate data structure is (<class 'int'>). It is usually not used for testing. isinstance() is used in testing because it takes into account whether the given object is an instance of a subclass as well.
